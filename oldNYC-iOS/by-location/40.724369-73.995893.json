The construction of the street necessitated the razing of many buildings in a northerly direction from Elm Street, which terminated at a point slightly south of Jersey Street, to Lafayette Place, which commenced at Great Jones Street. The new thoroughfare was named Lafayette Street several years later and under it was built the Interborough Rapid Transit Co.\n(I.R.T.) subway.\nNovember 23, 1900.\nBoard of Transportation Photograph.\nwilliam B.
