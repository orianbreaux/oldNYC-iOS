    "text": "St. George, Staten Island: An aerial view south across St. George on the Upper New York Bay. On the left are the freight yards of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, with the Municipal ferry terminal visible in part, on the left (white structure). Across the viaduct, which spans the freight yard and leads to the ferry terminal from Richmond Terrace, are municipal piers and American Dock Company warehouses clustered around Victory Boulevard. The thoroughfare running across the face of the view, above the B.& O. Railroad yard, is Richmond Terrace, terminating at the ferry ramp. Branching off from the former, to form the shape of a \"U,' is Stuyvesant Place. At the lower end of this \"U'-shaped area is the Richmond Borough Hall; preceding that is the Richmond County Court House, a hotel, and Richmond Police Headquarters (square building). In the right foreground is the 8-story Castleton Park Apartments, on St. Marks Place, site of the famous fashionable St. Marks Hotel; to its right is discernible a wing of Curtis High School, in Gothic architecture.\n\nEarly 1930s.\n",
