    "text": "Broadway, north from Bowling Green, with Battery Place on the left, and Beaver Street on the right. Sandwiched between these building giants, is Bowling Green, the first public park in Manhattan, surrounding which stood the homes of Lord Cornwallis, Lord Howe, Sir Henry Clinton, George Washington, General Gates, Benedict Arnold, Talleyrand and other famous personages of American History. To-day (1937), we find encompassing same, the Washington, Bowling Green, and Cunard Buildings on the west side of Broadway, and facing the curved Standard Oil Co. Building. On the right, a portion of the U.S. Custom House obstructs a view of the Produce Exchange Building.
