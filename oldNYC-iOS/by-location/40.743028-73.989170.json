The hotel was enlarged by annexing and remodelling on 24th and 25th Streets, and in 1885 the eight-story fireproof building, adjoining the 25th Street corner, was completed and opened. This was one of the most famous hotels of its time, and noted especially for its bar-room, on the 24th Street side, which was a veritable art gallery. In 1904 the old part of the hotel, facing on Broadway, will be demolished and rebuilt. The hotel will fina1ly close its doors in 1914, and the following year loft buildings will replace the Hoffman House and the Albemarle, in this block.\n",
