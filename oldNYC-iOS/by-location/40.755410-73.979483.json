    "text": "Fifth Avenue, east side, north from East 45th Street (right, not included). At the right is the Church of the Heavenly Rest (No. 551) that was built through the efforts of Dr. Robt. S. Howland then the Rector of the Church of the Holy Apostles. The parish originated in services held in the Hall of Rutgers Female College (q.v.) in 1865. Cast across the front, is the shadow of the Church of the Divine Paternity (Universalist) that stood at the S.W. corner of 45th Street. In the center is Windsor Hotel, prior to its destructive fire in 1899. The construction shown beyond is for the new St. Patricks Cathedral that was protected by Archbishop Hughs in 1850 from plans by James Renwick. The cornerstone was laid in 1858 and opened in 1879. 1892 saw it nearly completed with the exclusion of the Lady Chapel. The steeples were added in 1888.\n\nPossibly 1888\nCollection of George T. Bagoe\n86 Madison Ave., N.Y.C.",
