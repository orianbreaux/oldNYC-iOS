The corner building, which is now the 34th Street Ferry Storage Warehouse, is the former Miller Hotel, erected by Oliver Charlick, General Manager of the Long Island Railroad, for Tony Miller (Mueller). It was a rendezvous for sportsmen. Richard Croker and Tim Sullivan were guests here. The building was sold in 1917, altered, and then used as a phonograph manufactory. It appears from the photograph that the upper floor is used as living quarters; a saloon occupies the ground floor on the right. The building to the right is an old trolley barn, extending through to\n51st Avenue.\nP. L. Sperr  October 25, 1936\n\nNeg #2759\n",
