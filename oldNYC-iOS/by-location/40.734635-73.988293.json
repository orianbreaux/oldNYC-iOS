This structure was known as Amberg's Theatre in 1892, which opened here in 1888 and at which the Puenchener Company played on November 5, 1890. Upon this site formerly stood Irving Hall, opened December 20, 1860 for balls, lectures and concerts, and which was famous as a rendezvous for one faction of the Democratic party, to which it gave its name. Today (1938), this building is given over to Burlesque performances, a feature which aroused local interest when Judge Crain was District Attorney of Manhattan recently; this and adjoining property being in his family for years.
