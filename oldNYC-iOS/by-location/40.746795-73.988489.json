This was opened as Banvard's Museum in 1867, and during the succeeding twelve years, it was known as Wood's Museum and Metropolitan Theatre, Wood's Museum and Menagerie, and the Broadway Theatre. In it's early days it was both a museum and a playhouse, and in the early 70's it was the home of burlesque. Augustin Daly took possesion, remodelled it, and gave it its present name in 1879. It was again remodelled in 1891. The wing to 29th Street was added in 1892. Demolished in 1920, it was replaced with an 8 story office building.\nAbout 1905\nH. N.
