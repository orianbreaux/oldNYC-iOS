The 7-story building on the corner of Irving Place was erected around 1900.\nIn the 1930's this block will have changed little except by remodelling. 138-6 and 134 will lose their stoops, and the former front doors will become windows. The same thing will happen to 130; and the garage at 128 will be made over into a dwelling. The white balls will have been taken off the gateposts of the new house, No. 132; and No. 126, adjoining the little one-story studio, will have lost its portico.\nAbout 1912.\nGift of E. M. Jenks.",
