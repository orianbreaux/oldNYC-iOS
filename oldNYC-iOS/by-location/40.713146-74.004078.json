Bromleys Atlas of New York City, 1897) occupied by a frame work shed of the subway construction Co. This piece of ground is today (1937) incorporated in the site of the Municipal Building; forming the horthwestern corner of same. The view is westward and shows on Chambers Street (left) a low structure at the S.W. corner of Centre Street that was occupied by Fire Engine No. 7 and Hook and Ladder No. 1 Companies. This also has disappeared. The slightly larger edifice, that still stands today, is the old City Court. Over top the roof of the latter appears the peaked ornamentation of the Home Life Insurance Co. Building. Note the\nEmigrant Savings Bank sign.\n",
