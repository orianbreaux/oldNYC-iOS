This church edifice dates from between 1879 and 1885, but the church was organized in 1805, and later took over the former Free Congregational Church at 149-151 Sullivan Street adjoining, where the six-story tenement house is shown in this view. The site of the present church was occupied by a brewery. St. Anthony of Padua was the first Italian Roman Catholic congregation to be organized in New York.
