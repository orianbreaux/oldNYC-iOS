View No. 3 is limited to this corner.\n\nThe earlier view is photographed during the period while the old 6th Avenue \"El\" darkened the Avenue. View 2 is taken immediately after demolition of same.\n\nThe ornate structure above 18th Street is the former Siegel-Cooper Department Store. This institution widely published the phrase \"Meet me at the fountain.\" This was derived from the presence of a magnificent interior fountain and stairway. During the World War, (1917-18) this structure was utilized as a hospital.\n\nApril 3, 1935\nMarch 29, 1939\nMay 17, 1939\n\nP. L. Sperr",
