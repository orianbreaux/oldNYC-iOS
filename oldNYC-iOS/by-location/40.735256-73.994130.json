This property, held by the Hoffman family for more than 40 years, has been leased to the Frank G. Shattuck Co. for use as a Schraffts Restaurant in a modern Colonial style.\n\nThe history of this property goes back to the early Dutch days, same being a part of the estate of Hendrick Brevoort. The east branch of Minetta Brook ran just above it, turning south east across what is not Fifth Ave, and was in 1824, the northern extremity of the Ave.\n\nAbout 1850, the home of James Lennox stood here and a picture of same is in the possession of the Museum of the City of New York. In 1895 the present owners took possession, but never resided here. For a further account of this, see the New York Times of March 18, 1938, page 38.\n\nMarch 28, 1938.\n\nP. L.
