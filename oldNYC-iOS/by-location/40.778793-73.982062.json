    "text": "Broadway (then known as Boulevard), west side, from 72nd to 74th Streets, showing the Hotel St. Andrew in the foreground, and the Rutgers Memorial Church. The Hotel St. Andrew will stand in 1936, but the church will give way between 1920 and 1925 to a five-story building. About 1895. Brown Brothers.\n\nAccording to the New York Times of October 3, 1937, the Hotel built in 1893, will be replaced by a 4 or 5-story business structure. This site was the result (to himself and at a total cost of only $6,500) of a shrewd land speculation deal, by Robert Robertson in January 1886. It became the property of Morris Schinasi, the cigarette manufacturer at a later date and whose heirs are involved in the present transfer.\n",
