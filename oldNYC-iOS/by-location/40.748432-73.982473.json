On the N.E. corner of 36th Street may be seen the Madison Avenue side of the J.F. Morgan residence, which will shortly be remodelled as an annex to the Morgan Library. On the N.E. corner of 37th Street, in front of the large apartment hotel, is the old Delmar residence, the home since 1923 of the National Democratic Club.\n\nApril 1925.\n\nBrown Brothers, Photographers.\n",
