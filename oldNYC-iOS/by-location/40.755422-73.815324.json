This structure does not appear in the 1928 Queens Atlas. It was demolished and replaced by a modern two, three and five story structure. The hospital no longer faces on Forest Ave. as this one does but on Parsons Boulevard. The only portion of the original structure is the brick building seen in the background\n\nAbout 1909.\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection",
