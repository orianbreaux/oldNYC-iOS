    "text": "155th Street, east side, north of Forty-first Ave., showing the Old Bloodcood-Murray house. Mrs. Murray was the owner in 1860, and her estate from 1873-1891. It was erected in 1777. Eugene L. Armbruster, the Collector, states that this house was moved from its old site in 1923 because it was in the line of 155th Street. However, the writer believes the house was moved because of the widening of Northern Boulevard. See Queens Atlas of 1909. Originally this house faced north on Broadway; it now faces west on 155th Street.\n1924.\nEucene L. Armbruster Collection.\n",
