The branch office of Henry Clews and Company, above the Corn Exchange Bank, mournfully reminds one that the great Bull Market culminated less than a year before the date of this picture.\n\nThe 11-story Reliance Building was erected between 1902 and 1910, on the site of an old 4-story residence which was probably built in the 1850's, when Union Square was the Belgravia of New York.\n\n30, the Freiheit offices, is included in the view of 24-30 Union Square,taken the same day.\n\nUnion Square park, in the foreground, has just been drastically re-modelled.\n\nAugust 4, 1930.\nP. L. Sperr.\n",
