On the S.W. corner of 11th Street and Greenwich Avenue the old Continental Brewery was demolished around 1914 when Seventh Avenue South was opened. St. Vincent's Hospital, 153 West 11th Street at Seventh Avenue, is seen in the background.\n\nThis part of 11th Street, parallel to Charles, Perry, and Bank Streets, lost its own name around 1870, and was renumbered as a continuation of the true 11th Street, which is all east of Seventh Avenue.\n\nMay 20, 1933.\n\nP.
