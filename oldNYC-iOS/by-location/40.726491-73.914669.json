This is the Underhill Covert house. It is said that this house is on the site of or near that of the Pole's house of 1700. The farm was owned by John Dennian. His heirs sold it in 1717 to Richard Hallet, and from his heirs, Tunis Schenck and John R. Schenck purchased it. Subsequently Underhill Covert was the owner. Several of the old barns date back to the early 18th Century. One of the barns is said to be the original homestead of John Dennian who located here in 1662. The occupants bearing the Covert name were nderhill.1852 to 1860; C.G.,1873; and H., in 1891. The house was\ndemolished in 1931.\nMarch 1923.\nEugene L. Armbruster Collection.\n",
