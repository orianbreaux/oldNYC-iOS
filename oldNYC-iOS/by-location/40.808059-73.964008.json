The first street seen, on the left, is 119th Street; 117th and 118th Streets do not intersect Broadway because of the grounds of Columbia University, whose buildings flank Broadway to 119th Street. The U-shaped building on the north side of 119th Street is Barnard College. Behind the college is the Union Theological Seminary. At the extreme left is Grant's Tomb. North of 122nd Street the subway may be seen emerging from its tunnel. From 122nd to 125th Streets, the subway trains run on an elevated trestle, with an\nelevated station at 125th Street.\nMay, 1926.\nBrown Brothers.\n",
